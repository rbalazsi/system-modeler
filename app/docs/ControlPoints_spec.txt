System Modeler - control points: Specification

1. Definition
A control point is a small rectangle associated with a parent Visual that modifies its parent's bounding box in some way.
It is used for moving and resizing Visuals.


2. Movement constrained
Its movement can be constrained, which either means that it can be moved only in one axis, or it means that moving it one
axis would automatically move it with the same amount in the other axis, depending on the direction.

3. Types
Control points can have predefined locations:
 - Top Left
 - Top Center
 - Top Right
 - Middle Left
 - Middle Right
 - Bottom Left
 - Bottom Center
 - Bottom Right

4. Groups
Two or more control points can form a group that defines together the bounding rectangle of their parent Visual. Moving
one point would recalculate the box accordingly.
