# System Modeler - README

System Modeler is a tool that allows modeling arbitrarily complex systems using a navigable hierarchy of diagrams. Its main goal is to capture the documentation of a system's architecture in a single place as opposed to being scattered in multiple diagrams, thereby giving users a much better overview of it.
