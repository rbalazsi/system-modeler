1. Adding label (a.k.a. text?) to diagram items
 - label FX string property
 - double click triggers EDITING diagram item event
 - parent Diagram display a text box in which user enters text
 - pressing ENTER saves the label
 - pressing ESCAPE or clicking away cancels the editing, item text remains the same
 - expose styling as properties: Hor. , Vert. alignment, font size and color
 - !! reuse Label diagram item? standalone and attached to other item?
 - if font size is too big, recalculate width, resize parent but maintain its shape with same size (additional padding from width is calculated)
     => see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13015698/how-to-calculate-the-pixel-width-of-a-string-in-javafx

2. Vector graphics
 - define a custom control point
 - moving it modifies the bounded box of the parent item
     => need to recalculate and resize parent accordingly
 - parent item decides what to do with them
     => most probably they will form paths of some shape to draw

3. Arrows (REQUIRES Vector graphics)
 - another category of items
 - control points define the ends, they can be moved freely
 - expose a thickness property
 - other control points can also be added to make it free-form (not necessarily a straight line)
 - ?? curve-based arrows (bezier curves)?
 - can link two items together
    => if item moves/resizes, they need to be updated/redrawn as well
 - multiple arrow styles (see MS Visio for ideas)
