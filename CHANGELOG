TODO write up the changelog from previous commits

# 08-04-2016 Implemented labeling of items
 - 'text' exposed as string property
 - double click triggers EDITING diagram item event
 - parent Diagram displays a text box in which user enters text
 - pressing ENTER saves the label
 - pressing ESCAPE cancels the editing, item text remains the same
 - exposed styling as properties: font, text fill, alignment, baseline
 - created a Label diagram item, having only text, but no additional drawing

ISSUES:
 - clicking away when text box is shown does not close it, ENTER/ESCAPE needs to be pressed for that
