# Configured Gradle plugin
	https://github.com/FibreFoX/javafx-gradle-plugin

TODO write up the changelog from previous commits

# 08-04-2016 Implemented labeling of items
 - 'text' exposed as string property
 - double click triggers EDITING diagram item event
 - parent Diagram displays a text box in which user enters text
 - pressing ENTER saves the label
 - pressing ESCAPE cancels the editing, item text remains the same
 - exposed styling as properties: font, text fill, alignment, baseline
 - created a Label diagram item, having only text, but no additional drawing

ISSUES:
 - clicking away when text box is shown does not close it, ENTER/ESCAPE needs to be pressed for that


# 08-14-2016 Copy/Paste and Delete functionality
 - install right-click context menu on diagram items
    -> Copy - copies all selected items
    -> Delete - deletes all selected items
 - install right-click context menu on diagram
    -> Copy - if there are selected items (copies all selected), otherwise not shown
    -> Paste - if items were copied on clipboard, otherwise not shown
    -> Delete - if there are selected items, otherwise not shown
 - add items to Edit menu with the same behavior as in diagram right-click context menu
 - paste will duplicate the selected items and place them at cursor position
    -> copies maintain the positional relationships of selected items
 - shortcuts: Ctrl-C for copy, Ctrl-V for paste, DELETE for delete
 - Shift-drag Copy:
    -> when items are selected, holding down Shift and dragging the mouse will duplicate the selected items
    -> only if Shift is still down on mouse released event, otherwise operation is cancelled
    -> copies maintain the positional relationships of selected items


# 08-26-2016 Undo/Redo support
 - currently supported: copying to clipboard, selecting, pasting, drag-copying, adding, deleting, moving, resizing items
 - apply the Command design pattern for each supported operation
 - install Undo and Redo to Edit menu
    -> Undo is enabled if there was at least one operation already made
    -> Redo is enabled if there was at least one operation already undone
 - shortcuts: Ctrl-Z for Undo, Ctrl-Shift-Z for Redo
 - if, after Undo, other operation "path" is chosen, the Redo stack is cleared out
