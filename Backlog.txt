1. Vector graphics
 - define a custom control point
 - moving it modifies the bounded box of the parent item
     => need to recalculate and resize parent accordingly
 - parent item decides what to do with them
     => most probably they will form paths of some shape to draw

2. Arrows (REQUIRES Vector graphics)
 - another category of items
 - control points define the ends, they can be moved freely
 - expose a thickness property
 - other control points can also be added to make it free-form (not necessarily a straight line)
 - ?? curve-based arrows (bezier curves)?
 - can link two items together
    => if item moves/resizes, they need to be updated/redrawn as well
 - multiple arrow styles (see MS Visio for ideas)
