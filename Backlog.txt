1. Copy/Paste and Delete functionality
 - install right-click context menu on diagram items
    -> Copy - copies all selected items
    -> Delete - deletes all selected items
 - install right-click context menu on diagram
    -> Copy - if there are selected items (copies all selected), otherwise not shown
    -> Paste - if items were copied on clipboard, otherwise not shown
    -> Delete - if there are selected items (x replaced with nr. selected items), otherwise not shown
 - add items to Edit menu with the same behavior as in diagram right-click context menu
 - paste will duplicate the selected items and place them at cursor position
    -> copies maintain the positional relationships of selected items
 - shortcuts: Ctrl-C for copy, Ctrl-V for paste, DELETE for delete
 - Shift-drag Copy:
    -> when items are selected, holding down Shift and dragging the mouse will duplicate the selected items
    -> only if Shift is still down on mouse released event, otherwise items will only be moved
    -> copies maintain the positional relationships of selected items

2. Undo/Redo support
 - apply the Command design pattern for each operation
 - install Undo and Redo to Edit menu
    -> Undo is enabled if there was at least one operation already made
    -> Redo is enabled if there was at least one operation already undone
 - shortcuts: Ctrl-Z for Undo, Ctrl-Shift-Z for Redo

3. Vector graphics
 - define a custom control point
 - moving it modifies the bounded box of the parent item
     => need to recalculate and resize parent accordingly
 - parent item decides what to do with them
     => most probably they will form paths of some shape to draw

4. Arrows (REQUIRES Vector graphics)
 - another category of items
 - control points define the ends, they can be moved freely
 - expose a thickness property
 - other control points can also be added to make it free-form (not necessarily a straight line)
 - ?? curve-based arrows (bezier curves)?
 - can link two items together
    => if item moves/resizes, they need to be updated/redrawn as well
 - multiple arrow styles (see MS Visio for ideas)
