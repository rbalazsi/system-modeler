1. Vector graphics
 - define a custom control point
 - moving it modifies the bounded box of the parent item
     => need to recalculate and resize parent accordingly
 - parent item decides what to do with them
     => most probably they will form paths of some shape to draw

2. Linking diagram items
 - arrows as another category of items
 - control points define the ends, they can be moved freely
 - expose a thickness property
 - other control points can also be added to make it free-form (not necessarily a straight line)
 - ?? curve-based arrows (bezier curves)?
 - can link two items together
    => if item moves/resizes, they need to be updated/redrawn as well
 - multiple arrow styles (see MS Visio for ideas)

3. Property editors for items
 - property dialog box on double-click
 - common buttons on Toolbar: font, text alignment (H/V), fill & text color, paddings, etc.

4. Panning & Zooming on the diagram
 - create a zoomable ruler around the diagram
 - when dragging the diagram, it would pan to a previously non-clipped area (outside of current diagram view)
 - create a H/V scrollbar which is enabled when there are items in non-clipped area

5. UML item types
 - UML class diagram: class (including abstract), interface, enum
 - UML associations: association (uni/bidirectional), inheritance, interface implementation, aggregation, composition
    -> naming association roles, multiplicity
 - For class:
    -> access scopes for fields and methods: public, private, protected, default-scoped field types
    -> static modifier for fields
 - For interface: methods, constants
 - For enum: literals, fields??, constructors?? (review if UML standard supports it)

6. Associate a domain model for UML item types
 - domain class for each UML item type

7. Loading and saving diagrams
 - define an XML file format that stores
    -> items positions on diagram
    -> all their properties
 - create a serializer
 - .mxml file extension

8. Aligning items
 - H/V align items relative to each other (first selected, last selected, get ideas from MS Visio)
 - H/V align items relative to a custom ruler

9. Item hierarchies
 - Composite pattern for hierarchy
 - Project structure view populated with the hierarchy

10. Project Structure View - basic functions
 - clicking on an item will navigate to that sub-diagram
 - deleting an item will ask for confirmation to delete the whole sub-diagram
 - context menu with: delete
 - deletion is undoable/redoable
 - Shift-Click selects all other items (and sub-items) from previously selected item to currently selected one
 - Ctrl-Click will toggle between adding/removing the currently selected item to selection
 - when Ctrl-Shift selecting, focus would remain on previously selected item
