1. Copy/Paste and Delete functionality
 - install right-click context menu on diagram items
    -> Copy - if there are no selected items, copies current one, otherwise all selected items
    -> Delete - if there are no selected items, deletes current one, otherwise all selected items
 - install right-click context menu on diagram
    -> Copy, if there are selected items (copies all selected), otherwise not shown
    -> Paste, if items were copied on clipboard, otherwise not shown
    -> Delete x selected, if there are selected items (x replaced with nr. selected items), otherwise not shown
 - add items to Edit menu with the same behavior as in diagram right-click context menu
 - paste will duplicate the selected items and place them at cursor position
    -> copies maintain the positional relationships of selected items
    -> selects the newly pasted items
 - shortcuts: Ctrl-C for copy, Ctrl-V for paste, DELETE for delete
 - Shift Copy:
    -> when items are selected, holding down Shift and dragging the mouse will duplicate the selected items
    -> only if Shift is still down on mouse released event, otherwise items will only be moved
    -> copies maintain the positional relationships of selected items

2. Vector graphics
 - define a custom control point
 - moving it modifies the bounded box of the parent item
     => need to recalculate and resize parent accordingly
 - parent item decides what to do with them
     => most probably they will form paths of some shape to draw

3. Arrows (REQUIRES Vector graphics)
 - another category of items
 - control points define the ends, they can be moved freely
 - expose a thickness property
 - other control points can also be added to make it free-form (not necessarily a straight line)
 - ?? curve-based arrows (bezier curves)?
 - can link two items together
    => if item moves/resizes, they need to be updated/redrawn as well
 - multiple arrow styles (see MS Visio for ideas)
