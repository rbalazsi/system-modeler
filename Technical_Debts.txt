1. Integrate Spring, inject global components
 - inject: VisualItemRegistry, ChangeManager
 - remove the singleton pattern implementations from them

2. Extract event handler code outside Diagram
 - maintain a global DiagramStateManager, which includes items' positions and flags like isDragAndDrop
 - delegate handling to dedicated components (SelectHandler, DragAndDropHandler, MoveHandler, ResizeHandler)
 - define interfaces like Selectable, Movable, Resizable, Dragable, etc. make Visuals implement them
